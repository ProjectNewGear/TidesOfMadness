- HumanPlayer and AIPlayer should implement a common interface; GameDriver can then use those methods to treat both players the same
	for logic purposes within the game
- SetArtFromListBox: somehow I can get below 0???
- Better way to do Madness options? It probably shouldn't be decided by the GameDriver since the text is used by the UI
-Turn each GameState into it's own object, so that I don't have this weird ActOnPlayerInput loop that goes through complex CASE statements

---NEXT TIME ON DRAGONBALL Z:---

--Refresh list boxes on UI after returning five cards (data binding? BindingList?)
